\section{Basic binary I/O utilities}
\label{sec:pkg:rw}
The {\tt rw/} package provides a very rudimentary binary I/O capability
for quickly writing {\bf single record} direct-access Fortran binary files. 
It is primarily used for writing diagnostic output.
\subsection{Introduction}
Package {\tt rw/} is an interface to the more general {\tt mdsio/} package.
It can be used to write or read direct-access Fortran binary files for 
two-dimensional XY and three-dimensional XYZ arrays. Each call to an {\tt rw/}
read or write routine will read (or write) to the first record of a file.
To write files with multiple records use the package {\tt mdsio/} or the
package {\tt mnc/ \ref{sec:pkg:mnc}} which produces netCDF \cite{rew:97} 
based output.
