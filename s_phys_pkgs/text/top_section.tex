\chapter{Physical Parameterization and Packages}

In this chapter the schemes for parameterizing processes
that are not represented explicitly in MITgcm are described.
Some of these processes are sub-grid scale (SGS) phenomena,
other processes, such as open-boundaries, are external to the
simulation.
