\chapter{Physical Parameterization and Packages}

Within this chapter, the MITgcm ``packages'' are described.
Initially, ``packages'' were conceived to group source code files
together based upon their functionality.  Each package was assigned a
separate subdirectory (within \texttt{pkg}) and, usually, contained
source code for implimenting different physical parametizations.  This
was a convenient method for both segregating and rapidly including or
excluding parameterizations during the software build process.

Over time, package use increased.  The number of packages has grown
and they have evolved to contain much of the model functionality
including momentum schemes, I/O utilities, diagnostics, ``exchange''
algorithms, and numerous other processes that have no direct
connection to any specific physical parameterizations.  The following
sections describe how to use the existing packages and how to modify
them or create new ones.

%% In this chapter the schemes for parameterizing processes that are not
%% represented explicitly in MITgcm are described.  Some of these
%% processes are sub-grid scale (SGS) phenomena, other processes, such as
%% open-boundaries, are external to the simulation.
