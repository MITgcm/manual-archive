\chapter{Physical Parameterizations - Packages I}
\begin{rawhtml}
<!-- CMIREDIR:packages: -->
\end{rawhtml}

Within this chapter, the MITgcm ``packages'' are described.
Initially, ``packages'' were conceived to group source code files
together based upon their functionality.  Each package was assigned a
separate subdirectory (within \texttt{pkg}) and, usually, contained
source code for implimenting different physical parametizations.  This
was a convenient method for both segregating and rapidly including or
excluding parameterizations during the software build process.

Over time, package use has increased.  The number of packages has
grown and they have evolved to contain much of the model functionality
including momentum schemes, I/O utilities, diagnostics, ``exchange''
algorithms for domain decomposition, and numerous physical
parameterizations.  The following sections describe how to use the
existing packages and how to modify them and create new ones.

%% In this chapter the schemes for parameterizing processes that are not
%% represented explicitly in MITgcm are described.  Some of these
%% processes are sub-grid scale (SGS) phenomena, other processes, such as
%% open-boundaries, are external to the simulation.
