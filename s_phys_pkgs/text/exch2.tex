\section{exch2: Extended Cubed Sphere Exchange}
\label{sec:exch2}


\subsection{Introduction}

The exch2 package is an extension to the original cubed sphere exchanges
to allow more flexible domain decomposition and parallelization.  Cube faces
(subdomain) may be divided into whatever number of tiles that divide evenly
into the grid point dimensions of the subdomain.  Furthermore, the individual
tiles may be run on different processors in any combination, (tone this down 
a bit), and whether exchanges between particular tiles occur between different
processors is decided at runtime.
