\section{The line search optimisation algorithm
\label{sectionoptim}}

\subsection{General features}

The line search algorithm is based on a quasi-Newton
variable storage method which was implemented by
\cite{gil-mar:89}.

\subsection{The online vs. offline version}

\begin{itemize}
%
\item {\bf Online version} \\
Every call to {\it simul} refers to an execution of the 
forward and adjoint model.
Several iterations of optimization may thus be performed within
a single run of the main program (lsopt\_top).
The following cases may occur:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item
cold start only (no optimization)
\item
cold start, followed by one or several iterations of optimization
\item
warm start from previous cold start with one or several iterations
\item
warm start from previous warm start with one or several iterations
\end{itemize}
%
\item {\bf Offline version} \\
Every call to simul refers to a read procedure which
reads the result of a forward and adjoint run
Therefore, only one call to simul is allowed,
                     {\tt itmax = 0}, for cold start
                     {\tt itmax = 1}, for warm start
Also, at the end, {\bf x(i+1)} needs to be computed and saved
to be available for the offline model and adjoint run
\end{itemize}

In order to achieve minimum difference between the online and offline code
{\bf xdiff(i+1)} is stored to file at the end of an (offline) iteration,
but recomputed identically at the beginning of the next iteration.

\subsection{Number of iterations vs. number of simulations}

{\tt - itmax:} controls the max. number of iterations \\
{\tt - nfunc:} controls the max. number of simulations 
within one iteration

\paragraph{Summary} ~ \\
From one iteration to the next the descent direction changes.
Within one iteration more than one forward and adjoint 
run may be performed.
The updated control used as input for these simulations uses the same
descent direction, but different step sizes.

\paragraph{Description} ~ \\
From one iteration to the next the descent direction dd changes using
the result for the adjoint vector gg of the previous iteration.
In lsline the updated control
\[
\tt
xdiff(i,1) = xx(i-1) + tact(i-1,1)*dd(i-1)
\]
serves as input for
a forward and adjoint model run yielding a new {\tt gg(i,1)}.
In general, the new solution passes the 1st and 2nd Wolfe tests 
so {\tt xdiff(i,1)} represents the solution sought:
\[ 
{\tt xx(i) = xdiff(i,1)}
\]
If one of the two tests fails, 
an inter- or extrapolation is invoked to determine
a new step size {\tt tact(i-1,2)}.
If more than one function call is permitted, 
the new step size is used together
with the "old" descent direction {\tt dd(i-1)}
(i.e. dd is not updated using the new {\tt gg(i)}),
to compute a new 
\[
{\tt xdiff(i,2) = xx(i-1) + tact(i-1,2)*dd(i-1)} 
\]
that serves as input
in a new forward and adjoint run, yielding {\tt gg(i,2)}.
If now, both Wolfe tests are successfull, 
the updated solution is given by
\[
\tt
xx(i) = xdiff(i,2) = xx(i-1) + tact(i-1,2)*dd(i-1)
\]

In order to save memory both the fields dd and xdiff 
have a double usage.
%
\begin{itemize}
%
\item [{\tt xdiff}] ~\\
- in {\it lsopt\_top}: used as {\tt x(i) - x(i-1)} for Hessian update \\
- in {\it lsline}:    intermediate result for control update 
{\tt x = x + tact*dd}
%
\item [{\tt dd}] ~\\
- in {\it lsopt\_top, lsline}: descent vector, {\tt dd = -gg} 
and {\tt hessupd} \\
- in {\it dgscale}: intermediate result to compute new preconditioner
%
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{The parameter file lsopt.par}

%
\begin{itemize}
%
\item {\bf NUPDATE}
max. no. of update pairs {\tt (gg(i)-gg(i-1), xx(i)-xx(i-1))}
to be stored in {\tt OPWARMD} to estimate Hessian
[pair of current iter. is stored in 
{\tt (2*jmax+2, 2*jmax+3)}
jmax must be > 0 to access these entries]
Presently {\tt NUPDATE} must be > 0 
(i.e. iteration without reference to previous
 iterations through {\tt OPWARMD} has not been tested)
%
\item {\bf EPSX}
relative precision on xx bellow which xx should not be improved
%
\item {\bf EPSG}
relative precision on gg below which optimization is 
considered successful
%
\item {\bf IPRINT}
controls verbose (>=1) or non-verbose output
%
\item {\bf NUMITER}
max. number of iterations of optimisation;
NUMTER = 0: cold start only, no optimization
%
\item {\bf ITER\_NUM}
index of new restart file to be created (not necessarily = NUMITER!)
%
\item {\bf NFUNC}
max. no. of simulations per iteration
(must be > 0);
is used if step size {\tt tact} is inter-/extrapolated;
in this case, if NFUNC > 1, a new simulation is performed with
same gradient but "improved" step size
%
\item {\bf FMIN}
first guess cost function value
(only used as long as first iteration not completed,
i.e. for jmax <= 0)
%
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{OPWARMI, OPWARMD files}
Two files retain values of previous iterations which are
used in latest iteration to update Hessian:
\begin{itemize}
%
\item {\bf OPWARMI}: contains index settings and scalar variables

{\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{ll}
{\tt n  = nn}      & no. of control variables \\
{\tt fc = ff}      & cost value of last iteration \\
{\tt isize}        & no. of bytes per record in OPWARMD \\
{\tt m = nupdate}  & max. no. of updates for Hessian \\
{\tt jmin, jmax}   & pointer indices for OPWARMD file (cf. below) \\
{\tt gnorm0}       & norm of first (cold start) gradient gg \\
{\tt iabsiter}     & total number of iterations with respect to cold start
\end{tabular}
}
%
\item {\bf OPWARMD}: contains vectors (control and gradient)

{\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{cll}
entry & name & description \\
\hline
     1    & {\tt xx(i)}         & control vector of latest iteration \\
     2    & {\tt gg(i)}         & gradient of latest iteration \\
     3    & {\tt xdiff(i),diag} & preconditioning vector; (1,...,1)
for cold start \\
 2*jmax+2 & {\tt gold=g(i)-g(i-1)} & for last update (jmax) \\
 2*jmax+3 & {\tt xdiff=tact*d=xx(i)-xx(i-1)} & for last update (jmax)
\end{tabular}
}
