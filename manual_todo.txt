Rebuild and set to do cron build - DONE on hugo

To do

  - where to put under development links?
    JMC would like to have some mention of unfinished things (checked in 
     but not that tested e.g. AB3)
    Add an "Under development, chapter" - shortish description of what
    is available (last chapter)

  - add in example latex for formatting author names in different pieces.
    this aknowledges peoples contributions and gives ref for who
    to talk to.

>>>> from JM


manual, section.2 :

In general: 
- add more refences/links to S/R & variable name
- would be nice to have an active link to the fortran-file 
  for all the S/R & eq.Number in the "calling-tree" boxes
- search for CALC_MOM_RHS and replace it by the appropriate S/R
  (mom_flux_form, mom_vecinv, dynamics)
- Problem with notation: in section.1 \vec{\bf v_h} (or \vec{\mathbf{v}}_{h})
was used for the horizontal velocity vector, and the 3.D vector was \vec{\mathbf{v}}
in section.2, \vec{\bf v} is used instead and 3.D velocity vector is 
simply written \vec{v}.
I would suggest to keep the notation as they are (since they are consistent 
inside each section) but may be to move the "notation.tex" piece
at the beginning of section.2 and to mention clearly the changes between 
the 2 sections.

in content: Horizontal Dissipation: 2 times in vector-invariant section

2.1 time-stepping (part2/time_stepping.tex)

- this is not clear to me:

>> In all the above configurations it is also possible to substitute the
>> Adams-Bashforth with an alternative time-stepping scheme for terms
>> evaluated explicitly in time


2.2 rigid-lid:

- At some point, would be better to replace "g \eta" with "\Phi_s (cg2d_x)"
  to stay closer to the code.
- mention section 2.5 implicit-Time-stepping (for vertical viscosity)

2.3 linear free-surface: 
- add ref(+link) to S/R names:
- add ref(+link) to Crank-Nickelson section 2.9.1

2.4 Adams-Bashforth
- add stability diagrams (I have some figures that I can put)
- add link for var. forcing_In_AB
- add S/R link for S/R ADAMS_BASHFORTH2

2.5 Implicit time-stepping 
- add name of S/R: IMPLDIFF, GAD_IMPLICIT_R, MOM_U_IMPLICIT_R
	SOLVE_TRIDIAGONAL, SOLVE_PENTADIAGONAL
- update: also used for vertical advection

2.6 Synchronous time-stepping:
- add link for S/R THERMODYNAMICS, DYNAMCIS, SOLVE_FOR_PRESSURE,  
                   MOMENTUM_CORRECTION_STEP.

2.7 Stagger baroclinic time-stepping
- mention AB(T,S) instead of AB(Gt,Gs) (in development) at the end

2.8 NH
- add link & S/R names: CALC_GW, SOLVE_FOR_PRESSURE, CG3D

2.9 Variants on Free-Surface
- Delta.t mis-written (eq.2.73)
- Eq.Num missing (has been fixed since)
- u* is stored in gU (and not in gUnm1)
- Phi_nh in NH_VARS.h
- add link to S/R file: SOLVE_FOR_PRESSURE, CALC_DIV_GHAT, CG2D, CG3D, 
  INI_CG2D, INI_CG3D

2.9.1 Crank-Nickelson
- link for variable: implicSurfPress, implicDiv2DFlow, useRealFreshWater
 
2.9.2 NLFS
- eq.Nb are wrong in html
- 2.9.2.4 : set of eq. appears wrong in html (but right in .dvi) 

2.10.1 Notation
- Area definition is not really used like this

>> Ao : Area of the face orthogonal to "o" direction (o=u,v,w)

  Instead, in the following section, Ac,Aw,As,A_zeta (= corresponding to 
  the model variables) are used (e.g., see section 2.10.5)

2.10.5 Horizontal grid:
- fig.2.8 : should use Aw,As consistently in this figure description,
  in the figure itself, as it is in the text.
- curvilinear: 
  to add: mention the angle of the grid direction relative to 
  Eastward, Northward direction.
  + mention horizGridFile= in file "data" (PARM04)
- add cylindrical polar grid description
   need to do a better job of relating model variables to this diagram


2.11 Continuity & Horizontal Pressure gradient terms
 - mention that d.Phi/dr|s =g if using z coordinate 
 - eq. 2.90 not clear regarding \delta_k(P-E)
 better to add the free surface eq: d.eta/dt = w_s + P-E

2.12 Hydrostatic balance
 - add ref to Atmosphere Appendix section (1.4) since Adcroft 2002
   is hard to find
 - add ref to section 1.3.4 (Hydrostatic, Quasi-Hydrostatic & Non-H)
    and in section 1.3.4: remove the 1.3.4.3.2 subsection: 
                       Quasi-nonhydrostatic Atmosphere

2.13.2 Coriolis terms
 - note: the discretization used when useEnergyConservingCoriolis=T  
   has no hFac and no Area and is still different from the form 
   described here (with Area & hFac);

2.13.5 Lateral dissipation
 - add description of how to use cosFactor & cosPower
 - add the parameter correspondence: Ah <-> viscAh ; A4 <-> viscA4 
    o need to relate c11, c12 etc.. to COSFAC, USE_COS etc... flags
      in code need to explain why cos()3/2 turns out to be
      scaling (not cos()2)
 - need to reference the smag/leith section.

2.13.6 Vertical dissipation 
 - mention the implicit vertical viscosity option and ref to section 2.5
 - add the parameter correspondence: Av <-> viscAr (and might change also
   the notation to Ar)

2.14 Vector invariant momentum equations
 - indicate that the NH pieces (vertical momentum eq) are not yet coded
   and that the NH code uses the flux form.

2.14.6 Horizontal dissipation -> Horizontal Divergence

2.14.7 Horizontal dissipation
 - add the parameter correspondence: A_D,A_z <-> viscAhD,viscAhZ  
   and A_D4,A_z4 <-> viscA4D,viscA4Z 

2.16 & 2.17 & 2.18 : 
 - add 1rst Order upwind option & DST-2 (Lax-Wendroff) options
 - fix equations 2.202 & 2.203 (thanks to Martin)

2.20.2 mercator, non-dimensional Equations:
- does not use std notation
- would be better as an appendix of section 2.20:
(e.g changing the tile to:
- talk to Baylor
 Appendix: non-dimensional Equations on Spherical-Polar grid.)

Chapter 3
--------

Almost all of the 'math mode' text is dropped down as subscripts

3.1 - don't need a link to the outside of the document (remove it)
    - link to htdig is broken

3.2.1 - link at bottom to source code points to section 3.2.1
   (ie, to itself) - link should point to cvs code archive

3.2.2.1  - ('upgrading from an earlier version') belongs under
      the cvs part, ie, should be 3.2.1.1

3.3 - remove reference to 'diags' section under MITgcm
    - remove reference to 'exe' and 'bin' sections also
      (remove the .cvsignore file under these directories in cvs)
    - add a 'jobs' section, and a description as examples of run scripts
    - add 'lsopt', 'optim' and 'tutorial examples' with brief descriptions
    - under 'tools' add a reference to 'build_options'. refer to the 'optfiles'
    - under 'tools' the adjoint points to section 5 - this is now section 8
      (but should be a floating reference)
    - under 'utils' add a reference to exch2 - stuff for different resolutions
    - the description of the pkg section refers directly to
      section 3. should be section 6 (actually should be a floating reference)

3.4 - refer to sections 3.8 - 3.18 (now says 3.8 - 3.10)
3.4.1 - links to the following experiments don't exist or are broken:
          exp2 - should link to section 3.9
          hs94.cs-32x32x5 - link to section 3.12
          add 'convection' to the list, link to section 3.13
          add 'plume on slope` to the list, link to section 3.14
          add '??' link to section 3.15
          add 'dic_example on slope` to the list, link to section 3.16
          add '??' link to section 3.17
          add 'offline' and link to section 3.18
          clean up others and make links where they are needed
3.4.2 - text suggests to see section 2 for details about what is in the 'code'
        and 'input' directories - should refer to the examples in this section
      - add 'build' bullet - this is where the model is compiled and exectuable lives

3.5 - add some little text when talking about 'optfiles' to refer to the tools/build_options
      as the place where they live (add a link?)

3.6.1 - Add some general 'approach' text - ie, output is controlled either by the
        'data' file in the input directory or by the data.[pkg name] file for any
        package running. And there is some default behavior when the 'state' dumps
        are written.
3.6.1.2 - needs to be moved to inside section 3.6.2

All the 'overview' sections need some reference to the name of the experiment in
the verification directory

3.10 - in title, 4 degrees - degree symbol is a subscript, not a superscript
     - is this experiment in the list from section 3.4???
3.10.3.1 - refers to figures and equations, links are broken

3.11.3.2 - line 43: link to equation is broken
         - line 51-53: link to equation is broken
         - there is some mess of text hanging around the end of this section. remove? reformat?

3.12.4.1 - line 34 - link to equation is broken
         - lines 60,61 - 1st (take out the 'r' in the superscript)

3.13.2 - link to theta-equation is broken
3.13.5.4 -- ALL of the bold links to variable names are broken
            line 34: link to equation is broken

3.15.1 - reference to 'fourth experiment' should be removed

3.16.4 - strange formatting, presence of '>' symbols - remove them

3.17.3 - unknown verification directory pointed to - also: no link from list in sec 3.4
3.17.3.1 - nothing filled in under file input/data - needs description

3.18.2 - point to section 2 for details - need hyperlink

3.19.1 - text (2 places) says that section 3.5 called for compile in 'input' directory - not true!
         section 3.5 has the 'build' directory in the example

3.20.1 - link to doc at end of section points to this section
3.20.2 - link to doc at end of section points to this section

     offline - duplicate inputs, what is it, tidy up cfc v.
               other offline. JM thinks these need tidying up.

Here are the remaining bits for Chap 4 :

 - missing references (if you point me towards URLs, I'll add them
   to the bibliography):
     \ref{ref hoe and hill, ecmwf}
     \ref{magicgarden}
     \ref{IBMLAPI}
     \ref{Memorychannel}
     \ref{hoe-hill:99}

 - There are a few empty sub-sections at the end of Chap 4 that
   should either be commented out or fleshed out.

and thats about it for Chap 4.
