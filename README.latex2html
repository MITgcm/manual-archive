The vertical alignment of many images created by some latex2html
versions is poorly done and the patch in the file:

  latex2html_alignment.patch

mostly fixes it.  To apply the patch, simply run:

  cd /usr/bin
  sudo patch -p0 < /path/to/the/latex2html_alignment.patch

and that should take care of it.
