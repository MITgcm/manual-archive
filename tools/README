Scripts for manipulating and otherwise disassembling l2h output.

Driver for generating the latest manual from sources in CVS repo.
=================================================================
generate_latest_manual.sh  - This is coded for running on twain.lcs.mit.edu, which is the
                             only machine (apart from my laptop) with an l2h setup that can
                             cope with the manual.
                             It is run periodically by cron to keep the sealion-manual-latest
                             page up to date.

Adding subjects to the mailto: ref.
===================================
make_mail_subjects.sh   - Find mailto: block and substitutes a javascript block for
make_mail_subjects.awk    mailto:support@mitgcm.org?subject=....
                          where subject is the files TITLE block.

Finding figures and making substitutions in l2h output
======================================================

figsub.sh        - Finds figures that have been "rawhtml" MITGCM_INSERT_FIGURE_BEGIN
figsub.awk            marked for substitution.
                      Extracts html and records line numders
                      Output is written to 
                      figsub/filename/SUBNUM/extracted_html
                      figsub/filename/SUBNUM/startline
                      figsub/filename/SUBNUM/endline
                      where SUBNUM is the number of the current "rawhtml" marked region 
                      from file filename.

caption.sh       - Finds the caption within "extracted_html"
caption_do.sh      and writes it to figsub/filename/SUBNUM/extracted_html_caption
caption.awk     

img.sh           - Finds the IMG section that follows the CAPTION ( note captions
img_do.sh          can contain IMG ). This IMG should be the figure.
img.awk            It is written to figsub/filename/SUBNUM/extracted_html_img

labels.sh        - Finds the <A NAME=> entries from figsub/filename/SUBNUM/extracted_html.
labels_do.sh       These are the labels that are used as cross-reference targets within
labels.awk         the on-line document.
                   The entries are written to figsub/filename/SUBNUM/extracted_html_labels

fignum.sh        - Finds the <STRONG>...</STRONG> entry at the top of the _catpion extract.
fignum_do.sh       The text inbetween the markers should be the figure number.
fignum.awk         The entry is written to figsub/filename/SUBNUM/extracted_html_fignum
